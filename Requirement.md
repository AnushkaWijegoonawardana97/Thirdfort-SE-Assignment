Hi Anushka,

Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me about Thirdfort's Software Engineer position, I'm so sorry for the delayed response here.

We're delighted to progress you to the next stage of the process and invite you to complete the first stage of technical interviews with us which is a coding challenge.

The purpose of this challenge is to see how you approach a task on your own and find the best possible solution. Please use a language that you are comfortable with and you think is best for the given task.

There is no time limit on the challenge but it would be great if you could submit the challenge as soon as you're able to. We also wanted to let you know that our team will be taking some time off over Christmas so if you submit your challenge response after this week we likely won't get back in touch till the new year. Feel free to work with timelines that suit you here.

Please use GitHub to submit the coding challenge. If you are not familiar with GitHub this guide should help you to get started. Once completed, transfer your GitHub repo to our GitHub account (Username: sal-thirdfort) and let me know via email.

Coding Challenge

Your task is to build a REST API backend application that can be used to manage personal notes in a multi-user environment.

Requirements:

The API must have the following key features:

Save a new note
Update a previously saved note
Delete a saved note
Archive a note
Unarchive a previously archived note
List saved notes that aren't archived
List notes that are archived
You are free to use a technology stack of your choice to build the application. If you aren't familiar with building backend REST APIs, you can find a collection of examples at https://www.todobackend.com (Please note we are not advocating any method used in these examples).

What we are looking for:

Completeness of the API (at a minimum the API should be functionally complete to meet the requirements mentioned above)
Good coding practices (e.g. easy to read and manageable code, adding test cases etc.)
Use of industry best practices
If you think there should be other features not mentioned but required or good to have, you are free to add those features.

The API you create will be used by a UX team as the backend for a Personal Notes application they are building, consider how you would communicate your API details with the UX team. Once complete, save a README.md file with your code which should include:

How to run your application
Instructions to the UX team (i.e. how to use your API)
Your choice of technology and the reasons for using them (and any alternatives you considered)
If you were to spend more time on this task, what would you change and what other key features would you add.
If you have any questions at all in the meantime, please feel free to reach out. 

Best,

Nicole
